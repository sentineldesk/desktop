/**
 * A document this deployment can recognise, drawn as a chip rather than as underlined text.
 *
 * WHY A CHIP. A knowledge answer is mostly a claim plus the thing it came from, and those two want
 * to look different. Underlined blue text in the middle of a sentence reads as "more about this";
 * a chip with the file's own type on it reads as "this is the document", which is the whole point of
 * a connector that answers from a live system. It also survives the model's phrasing: whether it
 * writes "I found it in X" or lists three files, each one is drawn the same way.
 *
 * Recognition is by URL, and only Google's own document hosts. Anything else is an ordinary link,
 * because a chip asserts "this is a file in a system you have connected" and that is not something
 * to claim about a URL a model wrote.
